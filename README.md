# Code Review 2

#### By Anthony DiFalco

#### A brief quiz to find out what programming language best suits you

## Technologies Used

* HTML
* CSS/ Bootstrap
* JavaScript/ JQuery
* Git

## Description

This project contains one HTML file. On the page there are four questions and an additional color selection prompt. The question topics have very little to do with any of the programming languages. The answers at the top of each list add up to lower values, and the answers near the bottom add up to higher values.

Selecting different answers and then submitting will provide the user with a recommended programming language. Upon submitting, the background color will change to whichever color the user selected. For five of the languages, a text box is included which will allow you to input a string into amock "Hello world!" program.
